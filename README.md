Zus Interview - Chess Simulation.

## ToDo/Expansion
- Better string representation
- Handle Bishop movement (base case, only positive)
- What to do if negative? Like, goes left/down? <-- first thing
- Save/store game states
- ... also probably test base case lol
- Maybe CLI to make it more customizable instead of literally changing variables around
